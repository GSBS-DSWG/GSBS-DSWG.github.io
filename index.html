            About Us
        </h1>
        <p>

            The G&E Data Science Working Group is a student-led initiative aimed at helping Master’s and PhD GSBS
            students build practical computational and analytical skills.<br><br>

            Our mission is to make data science more approachable, collaborative, and directly applicable to biological
            research.<br><br>

            We host a mix of:

        <ul>
            <li>Lectures on core data science concepts</li>
            <li>Hands-on workshops using R, Python, and common analysis frameworks</li>
        </ul>

        All materials generated for these events will be archived here.

        </p>

        <h1>
            What You’ll Find Here
        </h1>

        <ul>
            <li>📂 Lecture slides (PDF or PowerPoint)</li>
            <li>📁 Workshop code (R scripts, Python notebooks, datasets)</li>
            <li>📝 Example workflows for common biomedical data science tasks</li>
            <li>🔗 Links to additional resources shared during sessions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Each session has its own repository containing all relevant files.
        </p>

            Who This Website Is For
        </h1>

        <ul>
            <li>GSBS graduate students (MS and PhD)</li>
            <li>Rotation students and incoming trainees wanting to build computational skills</li>
            <li>Researchers looking for accessible introductions to data science</li>
            <li>Anyone interested in applying quantitative methods to biomedical research problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            No prior coding or statistics experience is required—materials range from introductory to intermediate.
